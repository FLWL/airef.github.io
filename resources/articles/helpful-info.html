			<h3 id="local-targeting">How Local Targets Are Chosen</h3>

			<p>Question from Finaldeath: <a href="http://forums.aiscripters.com/viewtopic.php?p=57429#p57429">Link</a></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Local targeting specifically affects TSA when the units are not attacking the targeted building, and when reacting to a unit under attack (in the required sn-enemy-sighted-response-distance) right?</p>
				<p>If so this will really help. I presume siege weapons (specifically the ones hardcoded as "attacking buildings" - Petards, Trebuchets, Rams and Cannon Galleons) still act as normal and ignore this. :)</p>				
				<p>Thanks a lot - any improvement to those things are really nice and get over my befuddlement of AI armies doing silly things. I hope this puts the nail into the figurative coffin of "target evaluation SNs work" camp now :) since essentially that is what they were described as doing - this exact kind of thing.</p>
				<p>One thing before I test it fully - what weight does the factors add? Is it a mere +1? or +50% or something? If I set it to 1 ("deal most damage") and set Rams to priority 11 and everything else to priory -1 (including buildings) will it target Rams still? for instance will Pikemen ignore the Knights and attack the Rams?</p>

			<p>Answer from scripter64: <a href="http://forums.aiscripters.com/viewtopic.php?p=57430#p57430">Link</a></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Probably, yes, to the first question. It's the general targeting system, unrelated to attack groups, attack-now, and defensive TSA building targeting, which is used to go after nearby targets. With sn:1, the true attack value (attack+bonuses-armor) * 3 + offensive-priority-value = weight. If the true attack value is <= 1, then -5 weight is used instead. For sn:2, these things only apply if the target has >= 40 base pierce armor; otherwise, sn:2 = sn:0. In other words, sn:2 is primarily for defense from things like rams coming for your trebuchets, etc. With sn:1, you might get the best behavior.</p>
				<p>In addition, from the hard-coded 1.0c local targeting system, 5 weight is given to the current target, 0-75 weight based on distance (nearest available target is 75, farthest is 0), and 0-10 weight is given to time to eliminate the target based on number of hits and reload time. After all weights are added together, the target with the highest weight is attacked.</p>
				<p>However, units that don't move have reduced priority compared to units that move, except rams, cannon galleons, petards, and trebuchets have this ordering reversed and prioritize units that don't move first.</p>

			<h3 id="attack-group-targeting">How Attack Groups Select Targets</h3>
			<p>scripter64 shared how attack groups select targets for attack. This only applies to attack groups formed when sn-number-attack-groups is > 0 or attacks started with attack-now.</p>
			<p>Original source of description: <a href="http://forums.aiscripters.com/viewtopic.php?p=55847&sid=df575c787a2e0d1fb79e946e9d67fc43#p55847">Link</a></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>How the attack group (and attack-now lol) system selects targets:</p>
				<ol><li>group requests targeting</li>
					<li>get group characteristics:
						<ul><li>is this a water group?</li>
						<li>is there a unit in the group that targets only buildings? (<a href="https://airef.github.io/strategic-numbers/sn-details.html#sn-free-siege-targeting">sn-free-siege-targeting</a> is checked here)</li>
						<li>other stuff lol</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>if this is a warship group, the effective range of the group is calculated based on <a href="https://airef.github.io/strategic-numbers/sn-details.html#sn-warship-targeting-mode">sn-warship-targeting-mode</a></li>
					<li>loop through all available targets on the map for this group</li>
					<li>fill a list with all acceptable targets</li>
					<li>sort the list by offensive priorities/special-attack-type</li>
					<li>FINAL CHECK, where it used the shortest range unit to determine if a target in the list is reachable/acceptable
						<ul><li>now changed to longest range for warship groups</li>
						<li>land groups are still checked based on shortest range</li></ul></li>
					<li>send group to attack the final target</li>

			<h3 id="controlled-building-placement-system">Controlled Building Placement System (up-build place-control)</h3>
			<p>Here is an explanation of how the controlled building placement system works when you use place-control with the up-build command.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>This explains it better than I can:</p> 
				<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FUpDF.gif"></p>
				<p>Blue: home town center (red around it on the last series is the farm zone)<br>Red: target-player focus (or map center if target doesn't exist)<br>Green: possible placement region that expands each pass<br>Note: the red around the blue home town center in the last animation sequence is the hardcoded 1 tile distance that the AI engine requires between buildings.</p>
				<p>There are 3 series in the image with 4 passes each. I hope it's easy to visualize how they would continue to expand.</p>
